//Even though this is a small example with not a lot of components I used this approach to optimize imports for components
export { default as DarkModeButton } from "./DarkModeButton/DarkModeButton";
export { default as ThemeProviderComponent } from "./ThemeProvider/ThemeProviderComponent";
export { default as Navbar } from "./Navbar/Navbar";
export { default as Charts } from "./Charts/Charts";
